This project is a effort to consolidate java design pattern code examples into one standard codebase. These examples are wrapped in maven and executed using JUnit. Not everything is 100% working just yet, but it is close.

It is currently based on the following works...

[Headfirst Design Patterns](http://www.headfirstlabs.com/books/hfdp/)

[Java Concurrency in Practice](http://jcip.net/)

[Thinking in Patterns](http://mindview.net/Books/TIPatterns/)
